Project Description: Modern Developer Portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio website built with a modern, full-stack technology stack designed to showcase technical skills, optimize for performance, and deliver an exceptional user experience.

Next.js: The core of the application is built with Next.js, a full-stack React framework. Its hybrid rendering capabilities are leveraged to statically generate pages like the "About" or "Contact" sections for fast initial load times, while server-side rendering is used for dynamic project pages. This approach enhances both performance and SEO.

React: The user interface is constructed with React, a library ideal for building complex, interactive, and reusable components. The site's architecture is modular, with individual components for the header, project cards, and contact form, making the codebase clean and scalable.

Tailwind CSS: Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that enables rapid development of custom designs directly within the HTML markup. This allows for a consistent and responsive design system without writing custom CSS files, controlling everything from spacing and color to typography.

TypeScript: To ensure code quality and maintainability, the project is written in TypeScript. By adding static types to JavaScript, TypeScript helps catch errors during development, improves code readability, and makes the application more robust and easier to refactor.

Vercel: The website is deployed on Vercel, a platform optimized for Next.js applications. Vercel provides a seamless workflow with automated deployments from GitHub, a global Edge Network to ensure fast content delivery to users worldwide, and built-in features like automatic HTTPS and performance analytics.

Context API: Global state management, such as the theme (light/dark mode), is handled using React's built-in Context API. This avoids "prop drilling" by allowing components to consume shared data without passing props down through multiple levels of the component tree.

Google Analytics: To understand user behavior, Google Analytics is integrated to track key metrics. This includes monitoring page views, user engagement, traffic sources, and click events, providing valuable insights into how visitors interact with the portfolio.

React + Vite: For the development environment, the project leverages Vite's build tooling. Vite provides an extremely fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), significantly speeding up the feedback loop when making changes to the code. While Next.js has its own optimized compiler, Vite can be used for its rapid development experience.
